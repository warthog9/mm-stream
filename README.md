# MM Stream
This is basically the open sourcing of the stream processing we at FCIX's mirror project are using to collate the data we are getting.

Is it good?  Probably not.

Is it running?  As with all real infrastructure things: yes

Does it work WELL ENOUGH TO MOSTLY HALF IGNORE?  Also yes

Were folks bugging me to get this out so they could edit it too?  Also yes

Was this forked from something else?  Yes.  Long ago this started as tearing apart https://github.com/GilbN/geoip2influx.git unsurprisingly however I eventually wandered so far off it's frankly hard to even remotely claim it's the same thing.  That being said I don't remember if there's anything left of that project left in here so credit where it's due, I started there and have gone very far away from there it started.
